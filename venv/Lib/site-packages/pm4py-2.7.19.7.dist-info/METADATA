# PM4Py

PM4Py is a python library that supports state-of-the-art process mining algorithms in Python.
It is open source and intended to be used in both academia and industry projects.

PM4Py is managed and developed by PIS â€” Process Intelligence Solutions (https://processintelligence.solutions/),
a spin-off from the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT where PM4Py was initially developed.

## Licensing

The open-source version of PM4Py, available on GitHub (https://github.com/process-intelligence-solutions/pm4py), is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version
3 (**AGPL-3.0**).

We offer a separate version of PM4Py for **commercial use in closed-source environments** under a different license. For
more information about the licensing options for using PM4Py in closed-source settings, please
visit https://processintelligence.solutions/pm4py#licensing.

## Documentation / API

The documentation of PM4Py can be found at https://processintelligence.solutions/pm4py/.

## First Example

Here is a simple example to spark your interest:

import pm4py

if __name__ == "__main__":
    log = pm4py.read_xes('<path-to-xes-log-file.xes>')
    net, initial_marking, final_marking = pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive(log)
    pm4py.view_petri_net(net, initial_marking, final_marking, format="svg")

## Installation
PM4Py can be installed on Python 3.9.x / 3.10.x / 3.11.x / 3.12.x / 3.13.x / 3.14.x by invoking:

pip install -U pm4py

PM4Py is also running on older Python environments with different requirements sets, including:

- Python 3.8 (3.8.10): third_party/old_python_deps/requirements_py38.txt

## Requirements

PM4Py depends on some other Python packages, with different levels of importance:

* *Essential requirements*: numpy, pandas, deprecation, networkx
* *Normal requirements* (installed by default with the PM4Py package, important for mainstream usage): graphviz,
  intervaltree, lxml, matplotlib, pydotplus, pytz, scipy, tqdm
* *Optional requirements* (not installed by default): requests, pyvis, jsonschema, workalendar, pyarrow, scikit-learn,
  polars, openai, pyemd, pyaudio, pydub, pygame, pywin32, pygetwindow, pynput

## Release Notes

To track the incremental updates, please refer to the CHANGELOG.md file.

## Third Party Dependencies

As scientific library in the Python ecosystem, we rely on external libraries to offer our features.
In the /third_party folder, we list all the licenses of our direct dependencies.
Please check the /third_party/LICENSES_TRANSITIVE file to get a full list of all transitive dependencies and the
corresponding license.
