    Apply token-based replay for conformance checking analysis.
    This method returns the full token-based replay diagnostics.

    Token-based replay matches a trace against a Petri net model, starting from the initial marking, to discover which transitions are executed and in which places there are remaining or missing tokens for the given process instance. Token-based replay is useful for conformance checking: a trace fits the model if, during its execution, all transitions can be fired without the need to insert any missing tokens. If reaching the final marking is imposed, a trace fits if it reaches the final marking without any missing or remaining tokens.

    In PM4Py, the token replayer implementation can handle hidden transitions by calculating the shortest paths between places. It can be used with any Petri net model that has unique visible transitions and hidden transitions. When a visible transition needs to be fired and not all places in its preset have the correct number of tokens, the current marking is checked to see if any hidden transitions can be fired to enable the visible transition. The hidden transitions are then fired, reaching a marking that permits the firing of the visible transition.

    The approach is described in:
    Berti, Alessandro, and Wil MP van der Aalst. "Reviving Token-based Replay: Increasing Speed While Improving Diagnostics." ATAED@ Petri Nets/ACSD. 2019.

    The output of the token-based replay, stored in the variable `replayed_traces`, contains for each trace in the log:

    - **trace_is_fit**: Boolean value indicating whether the trace conforms to the model.
    - **activated_transitions**: List of transitions activated in the model by the token-based replay.
    - **reached_marking**: Marking reached at the end of the replay.
    - **missing_tokens**: Number of missing tokens.
    - **consumed_tokens**: Number of consumed tokens.
    - **remaining_tokens**: Number of remaining tokens.
    - **produced_tokens**: Number of produced tokens.

        * **walk_through_hidden_trans**: Boolean to decide if the replay should walk through hidden transitions to enable visible transitions.

    Apply the alignments algorithm between a log and a process model.
    This method returns the full alignment diagnostics.

    Alignment-based replay aims to find one of the best alignments between the trace and the model. For each trace, the output of an alignment is a list of pairs where the first element is an event (from the trace) or ``»`` and the second element is a transition (from the model) or ``»``. Each pair can be classified as follows:

    - **Sync move**: The event and transition labels correspond, advancing both the trace and the model simultaneously.
    - **Move on log**: The transition is ``»``, indicating a replay move in the trace that is not mirrored in the model. This move is unfit and signals a deviation.
    - **Move on model**: The event is ``»``, indicating a replay move in the model not mirrored in the trace. These can be further classified as:
        * **Moves on model involving hidden transitions**: Even if it's not a sync move, the move is fit.
        * **Moves on model not involving hidden transitions**: The move is unfit and signals a deviation.

    For each trace, a dictionary is associated containing, among other details:

    - **alignment**: The alignment pairs (sync moves, moves on log, moves on model).

    Calculate precision using token-based replay.

    Token-based replay matches a trace against a Petri net model, starting from the initial marking, to discover which transitions are executed and in which places there are remaining or missing tokens for the given process instance. Token-based replay is useful for conformance checking: a trace fits the model if, during its execution, all transitions can be fired without the need to insert any missing tokens. If reaching the final marking is imposed, a trace fits if it reaches the final marking without any missing or remaining tokens.

    In PM4Py, the token replayer implementation can handle hidden transitions by calculating the shortest paths between places. It can be used with any Petri net model that has unique visible transitions and hidden transitions. When a visible transition needs to be fired and not all places in its preset have the correct number of tokens, the current marking is checked to see if any hidden transitions can be fired to enable the visible transition. The hidden transitions are then fired, reaching a marking that permits the firing of the visible transition.

    The approach is described in:

    Muñoz-Gama, Jorge, and Josep Carmona. "A fresh look at precision in process conformance." International Conference on Business Process Management. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2010.

    In this approach, the different prefixes of the log are replayed (if possible) on the model. At the reached marking, the set of transitions that are enabled in the process model is compared with the set of activities that follow the prefix. The more the sets differ, the lower the precision value. The more the sets are similar, the higher the precision value.

    Calculate the precision of the model with respect to the event log using alignments.

    Alignment-based replay aims to find one of the best alignments between the trace and the model. For each trace, the output of an alignment is a list of pairs where the first element is an event (from the trace) or ``»`` and the second element is a transition (from the model) or ``»``. Each pair can be classified as follows:

    - **Sync move**: The event and transition labels correspond, advancing both the trace and the model simultaneously.
    - **Move on log**: The transition is ``»``, indicating a replay move in the trace that is not mirrored in the model. This move is unfit and signals a deviation.
    - **Move on model**: The event is ``»``, indicating a replay move in the model not mirrored in the trace. These can be further classified as:
        * **Moves on model involving hidden transitions**: Even if it's not a sync move, the move is fit.
        * **Moves on model not involving hidden transitions**: The move is unfit and signals a deviation.

    A log skeleton is a declarative model consisting of six different constraints:
    - **directly_follows**: Specifies strict bounds on activities directly following each other. For example, 'A should be directly followed by B' and 'B should be directly followed by C'.
    - **always_before**: Specifies that certain activities may only be executed if some other activities have been executed earlier in the case history. For example, 'C should always be preceded by A'.
    - **always_after**: Specifies that certain activities should always trigger the execution of other activities in the future history of the case. For example, 'A should always be followed by C'.
    - **equivalence**: Specifies that pairs of activities should occur the same number of times within a case. For example, 'B and C should always happen the same number of times'.
    - **never_together**: Specifies that certain pairs of activities should never occur together in the case history. For example, 'No case should contain both C and D'.
