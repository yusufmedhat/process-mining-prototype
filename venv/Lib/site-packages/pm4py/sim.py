    Performs the playout of the provided model, generating a set of traces.

    The function accepts one of the following inputs:
    - A Petri net with initial and final markings.
    - A Directly-Follows Graph (DFG) represented as a dictionary.
    - A process tree.

    :param args:
        - For Petri net playout: a `PetriNet`, an initial `Marking`, and a final `Marking`.
        - For DFG playout: a `dict` representing the DFG, followed by additional required arguments.
        - For process tree playout: a single `ProcessTree`.
    :param kwargs: Optional parameters of the method, including:
        - `parameters`: A dictionary containing parameters of the playout, such as:
            - `smap`: (optional) A stochastic map to be used for probabilistic transition selection.
            - `log`: (optional) An `EventLog` used to compute the stochastic map if `smap` is not provided.
